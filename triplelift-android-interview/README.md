Our server has a URL endpoint that will return the performance (number of clicks and impressions) of a given advertiser over the past week (see JSON example below).

Create a Simple iOS or Android app that will do the following:

1. Create a UI that allows me enter to enter multiple advertiser ids<br />
Does not have to be very fancy but more elegant than a comma separated list
2. Have a submit button that on click will:<br />
Make all the needed API calls<br />
Render a table showing the impression and clicks aggregated by date for all the advertiser idï¿½s submitted.
3. Bonus points if:<br />
You make the table sortable<br />
You update the table with data as the api calls come back<br />
Use concurrency and parallelization<br />
4. Style the app to your taste.<br />
 
Note: Take performance into consideration (eg a large number of advertiser id's will be submitted)
